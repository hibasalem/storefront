# Store Front

an application that will power an online storefront that will allow our users to browse our product offerings by category, place items in their shopping cart, and check-out when they are ready to make their purchase

**_Phase 1_**: starting the process of creating an e-Commerce storefront using React with Redux, coupled with your live API server

**_Phase 2_**: Continue work on the e-Commerce storefront, breaking up the store into multiple reducers and sharing functionality/data between components
